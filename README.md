# MasturBass
Bass fretboard training app project. Mastur your bass skills!

It's also my first Python + Kivy + pink app.

## How does it work?

MasturBass is a turn-based bass masturing application. 

The app asks user to indicate the position of a particular sound on the fretboard. The name of the sound changes every turn and each turn is shorter than the turn before.

The player's goal is to guess as many sounds as possible in each round and make no mistakes.

The more sounds player guesses, the more score points he earns.
